# Deployment Setup Summary ðŸŽ‰

Great news! Your app is now **ready for deployment**. Here's what I've set up for you:

## âœ… What's Been Done

### 1. **Backend Configuration** âœ“
- Updated `main.py` to support dynamic CORS origins via environment variables
- Created `Procfile` for easy deployment to Render/Railway/Heroku
- Created `render.yaml` for one-click Render deployment
- Backend will automatically use `PORT` environment variable in production

### 2. **Frontend Configuration** âœ“
- Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to use environment variables for API/WebSocket URLs
- Created `vercel.json` for Vercel deployment configuration
- Frontend now supports both local development and production URLs

### 3. **Documentation** âœ“
- Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step instructions
- Updated `README.md` with project information and quick start guide
- Created example environment files (`.env.example`, `.env.local.example`)
- Added `deploy-setup.sh` helper script

### 4. **Environment Variables Setup** âœ“
Your app now uses these environment variables:

**Backend (.env):**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Comma-separated list of allowed frontend URLs

**Frontend (.env.local):**
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Clerk authentication key
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL
- `VITE_WS_URL` - Backend WebSocket URL

## ðŸš€ Next Steps - Actual Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy to Render + Vercel (Recommended)

#### A. Deploy Backend to Render (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://render.com and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
3. Connect your repo: `Rahbir1518/HackTheValleyX`
4. Configure:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. Add environment variable:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` = your actual Gemini API key
6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. **Copy your backend URL** (e.g., `https://hackthevalleyx-backend.onrender.com`)

#### B. Deploy Frontend to Vercel (3 minutes)
1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Import `Rahbir1518/HackTheValleyX`
4. Add environment variables:
   - `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = your Clerk key
   - `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com`
   - `VITE_WS_URL` = `wss://your-backend-url.onrender.com` (note: wss, not ws)
5. Click "Deploy"
6. **Copy your frontend URL** (e.g., `https://hackthevalleyx.vercel.app`)

#### C. Update CORS Settings
1. Go back to Render â†’ Your backend service â†’ Environment
2. Add/Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
   ```
   https://hackthevalleyx.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
   ```
3. Save and wait for redeploy

#### D. Update Clerk
1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Add your Vercel domain to allowed domains
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰

### Option 2: Deploy Both to Railway (Alternative)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create project from GitHub repo
3. Add two services (backend and frontend)
4. Configure environment variables for each
5. Deploy!

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed Railway instructions.
