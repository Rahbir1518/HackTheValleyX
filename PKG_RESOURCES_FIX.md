# 🔧 FIXED: pkg_resources Error on Render

## ❌ The Problem

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
[ERROR] Failed to extract features from uploaded audio
```

**Root Cause:** `librosa` requires `pkg_resources` (from `setuptools` package), but it wasn't in `requirements.txt`.

## ✅ The Fix

Added `setuptools==69.0.0` to `requirements.txt`

## 🚀 What Happens Now

1. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
2. ⏳ Render will auto-detect the push and start redeploying (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. ✅ New deployment will include `setuptools`
4. ✅ Audio feature extraction will work!

## 📊 How to Monitor the Fix

### **Step 1: Watch Render Deployment**

Go to your Render dashboard and look for:
```
🔄 Deploying...
==> Installing from requirements.txt
==> Installing setuptools==69.0.0  ← You should see this now
==> Build successful
==> Starting service...
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### **Step 2: Check Logs After Deployment**

After deployment completes, test the upload endpoint. In Render logs, you should now see:

**BEFORE (Error):**
```
[ERROR] Error extracting features: No module named 'pkg_resources'
[ERROR] Failed to extract features from uploaded audio
```

**AFTER (Success):**
```
[DEBUG] Loading audio with librosa...
[DEBUG] Audio loaded: 181440 samples at 16000Hz
[DEBUG] Extracting RMS energy...
[DEBUG] Feature extraction completed successfully!
✅ Successfully extracted features from uploaded audio
```

### **Step 3: Test the Endpoint**

Once Render shows "Live", test your endpoint:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Render URL
curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/upload-base-audio \
  -F "file=@audio/base.wav"
```

**Look for in response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "uploaded_features": { ... },  ← Should have data now!
  "base_features": { ... },      ← Should have data!
  "analysis": { ... }            ← Should have risk assessment!
}
```

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

- **Now:** Code pushed to GitHub ✅
- **+1 min:** Render detects push and starts build
- **+2-3 min:** Build completes
- **+3-4 min:** Service restarts with fix
- **+4 min:** Ready to test! 🎉

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After Render redeploys, verify:

- [ ] Render build logs show `setuptools==69.0.0` installed
- [ ] Service status shows "Live" (green)
- [ ] Test upload returns `"status": "success"`
- [ ] `uploaded_features` is NOT null
- [ ] `analysis` is NOT null
- [ ] Logs show "Feature extraction completed successfully!"

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

If you still see errors after redeployment:

1. **Check Render Environment Variables are set:**
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`

2. **Check Render logs for other errors**

3. **Manually trigger redeploy:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Select "Clear build cache & deploy"

## 📝 What Was Changed

**File:** `requirements.txt`

**Added:** `setuptools==69.0.0`

This package provides `pkg_resources` which `librosa` needs to load audio files.

---

## 🎉 Summary

The error was a **missing dependency** (`setuptools`), not an issue with the Blob storage code!

✅ Fix committed and pushed  
⏳ Render is redeploying now  
🚀 Should work in ~3 minutes!

**Your audio comparison feature will work once Render finishes deploying!**
