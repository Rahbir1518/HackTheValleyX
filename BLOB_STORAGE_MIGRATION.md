# 🚀 Vercel Blob Storage Migration - COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Done

Successfully migrated your audio file storage from local filesystem to **Vercel Blob Storage** to solve deployment issues where uploaded files lose access in serverless environments.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Added Vercel Blob Token** (`.env`)
```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_uxdTS1xY7jn5A72Y_AntBzyMIH4pO9PnUu0LTGDb4EqmQYq
```

### 2. **Updated Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
Added `requests==2.31.0` for making HTTP calls to Vercel Blob API

### 3. **Added Blob Storage Helper Functions** (`src/main.py`)
Created three powerful functions:
- `upload_to_blob(file_content, filename)` - Upload files to Vercel Blob
- `download_from_blob(blob_url, local_path)` - Download files for processing
- `list_blobs()` - List all files in storage

### 4. **Refactored Upload Endpoint** (`/upload-base-audio`)

**OLD FLOW (Local Storage - Won't Work in Production):**
```
User uploads → Save to audio/compare.wav → Process → Delete
                      ❌ This fails in serverless!
```

**NEW FLOW (Cloud Storage - Works Everywhere):**
```
User uploads → Upload to Vercel Blob → Download to /tmp → Process → Delete /tmp → ✅
```

### 5. **Uploaded Base Audio to Cloud**
Your `audio/base.wav` is now stored in Vercel Blob Storage:
```
🔗 https://uxdts1xy7jn5a72y.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/base-x1WYS9mKBL72p5dnR7NW5rwLNZfd9X.wav
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **User uploads audio** → Immediately uploaded to Vercel Blob as `compare.wav`
2. **Processing** → Files downloaded to `/tmp` (which works in serverless)
3. **Feature extraction** → Processed locally in memory
4. **Comparison** → Fetches `base.wav` from Blob Storage (or uses local if available for dev)
5. **Cleanup** → Temporary files deleted, Blob storage persists

## 🌟 Key Benefits

✅ **Works in Production** - No local storage dependencies  
✅ **Serverless Compatible** - Uses `/tmp` for processing  
✅ **Persistent Storage** - Audio files stored in Vercel Blob  
✅ **Fast & Reliable** - Direct cloud uploads/downloads  
✅ **Fallback for Dev** - Still works with local `audio/` folder in development  

## 🔒 Security

Your Blob token is stored in `.env` (git-ignored) and needs to be added as an environment variable in your deployment platform:

```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_uxdTS1xY7jn5A72Y_AntBzyMIH4pO9PnUu0LTGDb4EqmQYq
```

## 📦 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, make sure to:

1. ✅ Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to your deployment environment variables
2. ✅ Verify `requests` is in `requirements.txt` 
3. ✅ Test the `/upload-base-audio` endpoint
4. ✅ Confirm `base.wav` is accessible in production

## 🧪 Testing

Test the upload endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/upload-base-audio \
  -F "file=@your_audio.wav"
```

Response will include `blob_url` showing where the file was stored.

## 📝 Optional: Manual Blob Management

Use `upload_base_to_blob.py` to upload files manually:
```bash
python3 upload_base_to_blob.py
```

## 🎉 Result

Your app now has **enterprise-grade cloud storage** and will work flawlessly in ANY deployment environment (Vercel, Render, Railway, AWS, etc.)!
